                I am a passionate software engineer with over three years of experience specializing in developing innovative training simulations and interactive environments. My expertise lies in C#, Unity Game Engine, and full stack development, with a focus on creating detail-rich, scalable applications for military and government training initiatives. 
                <br></br>
                In my career, I’ve developed 3D simulation applications, built gamified cross-platform systems, and optimized workflows through custom tools and automation. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Game & Emerging Media from Marist College and am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science to deepen my analytical and technical skill set.
                <br></br>
                When I’m not coding, you can find me tinkering with 3D modeling and printing, biking, or hunting down the best Guinness in town. Let’s connect and create something extraordinary! </span>
