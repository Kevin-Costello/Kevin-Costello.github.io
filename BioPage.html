				<h1 class="head">Hi, I'm Kevin Costello</h1>
				<span class="sub2"> I am a Marist College class of 2020 graduate, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in both Computer Science and Games & Emerging Media. 
									I also hold two minors in Information Systems and Information Technology. While working towards my Undergraduate degree, I was fortunate enough to be 
									invited to present some of my work at the 2020 Game Developers Conference. This opportunity reinforced my desire to forge a career in the Games Industry.
									Currently I am solo developing an RTS survival game, which I hope to publish within the year. My goal for the future is to work for a distinguished game development studio
									so I may learn from and train with the best in the industry.
