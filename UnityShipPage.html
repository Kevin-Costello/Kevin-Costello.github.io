                <span id="description">Inspired by Assassins Creed: Black Flag, this is my attempt at recreating the ocean and ship physics used in the game. 
                    
                                       <br><br>I started out with creating a basic trangle based mesh in Unity. The script which handles this creates square tiles split into two trangles. The 
                                       vertices of these triangles are indexed and their Y positions are manipulated with Perlin Noise.

                                       <br><br><br><br>Once the mesh was working properly I started experimenting with some materials. In order to make an applied material visibile I had to first manually create UV's
                                       for the mesh since they do not generate themselves automatically.

                                       <br><br><br><br>I then modeled a low-poly boat in Blender and imported it into the scene. Similar to how the ships in Assassins Creed: Black Flag function, I gave the ship 'float points' 
                                       which compare their Y position to the height of the waves. If the float point is ever below a wave, the ship bobs up, and if the float point is ever 
                                       above a wave, the ship bobs down.
