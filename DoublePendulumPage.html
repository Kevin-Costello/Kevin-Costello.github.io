                <span id="description">One of my first attempts at exploring kinematics: <br><br>Double pendulums exhibit a strong chaotic behaviour due to their high 
                                       sensitivity of initial conditions and thus pose as a great visual representation when researching Chaos Theory.<br><br>For the Double Pendulum 
                                       we define the horizontal and vertical positions of pendulum mass, the angle of the pendulum, and the length of the rod. These variables 
                                       are defined a second time for the second pendulum segment. <br><br>The points of mass are set to a randomized location and given 
                                       an initial force, a gravitational constant, and a dampening factor. Two algebraic equations are then implemented to calculate the angle 
                                       of each pendulum mass as it is moving. <br><br> A line is then drawn at the center of the second pendulum mass to visualize the movement trajectory 
                                       and the color is interpolated based on the X location as a stylization touch. <br><br> You can refresh the page to see the pendulum start at different positions.
